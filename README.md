# My Portfolio
![Last commit badge](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/qkr0wns/my-portfolio)

## Description
### What is this?
A professional portfolio meant to showcase my abilities as a full stack web developer.

### How was it made?
I used HTML and vanilla CSS to structure and style my webpage based on a wireframe I created.

My initial wireframe:

The final webpage (on desktop) looks like this:

### Care was put into:
- Responsive design for standard viewport widths (using CSS flexbox and media queries).
- Logical image grid layout in *Projects* section (using CSS grid).
- Accessibility; no legibility issues.
- Structuring and commenting my CSS for maintainability and good DX.
- Semantic HTML.

## Usage
To see the website, go to [https://qkr0wns.github.io/my-portfolio/](https://qkr0wns.github.io/my-portfolio/).

To see the HTML and CSS files, inspect the webpage in your browser. Alternatively, view index.html and style.css directly in GitHub, or clone the repository to view them in the code editor of your choice.

## Future Goals
- Replace placeholder images in *Projects* section with actual web development projects I have worked on.
- Replace dummy text in *Experience* section; flesh out descripitions of previous work experience.
- Update website with interactivity and enhanced visuals using JavaScript and front-end frameworks/libraries.
